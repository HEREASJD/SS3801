	<h2>Michigan's Energy Goals</h2>
	<p>
		Michigan's renewable energy goal is to achieve a renewable energy credit portfolio of 60% by 2035. 
		The team proposes a multi-faceted plan to achieve Michigan's renewable energy goals with focuses on wind and solar energy sources. In addition to further investment in renewable energy infrastructure, 
		Michigan will need to leverage tax incentives, explore energy storage solutions, and continue to invest in workforce development.
	
	</p>
	
	<h2>Michigan's 2023 Energy Breakdown</h2>
	<li> Natural Gas: 55.5 TWh (45.7%) </li>
	<li> Nuclear: 27.8 TWh (22.9%) </li>
	<li> Coal: 22.9 TWh (19.2%) </li>
	<li> Renewables: 13.3 TWh (11%) </li>
	
	<p>
		Renewable Energy Breakdown</p>
	<li> Wind: 8.4 TWh (6.9%) </li>
	<li> Biomass: 2.5 TWh (1.7%) </li>

	<p> 
		Renewables represent 11% of the energy generated in Michigan in 2023. With a target of 60% by 2035, Michigan's ambitious goal will require a significant effort, starting by 
		investing in the rewenewable energy sources best suited for Michigan. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Proposed Target 2035 Energy Breakdown</h2>
	<li> Wind: ~30% </li>
	<li> Nuclear: ~20% </li>
	<li> Solar: ~15% </li>
	<li> Natural Gas: ~15% </li>
	<li> Biomass:  ~10% </li>
	<li> Hydropower: ~5% </li>
	<li> Coal: ~5% </li>
	
	<h2>Wind</h2>
	<p>
		Wind is the most feasible energy source for implementation on a large scale in Michigan. Large, open spaces in the form of farmland or offshore on the Great Lakes provide many locations for consistent, high speed winds. A combination of onshore and offshore wind would be capable of meeting Michigan's renewable energy needs. 
		Onshore wind farms should be expanded in the thumb region and in the Gratiot County area, where winds are ideal for wind power. In addition to onshore wind, development of offshore wind farms holds potential for generating a large amount of the state's energy and would help the state make large strides towards the state's goals.
		Lake Huron and Michigan are ideal locations for their proximity to power transmission infrastructure, relatively calm conditions, and access to reliable, high speed winds.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Wind Energy Challenges</h2>
	<p>
		Despite high potential, wind energy faces several large social challenges. In general, people dislike the appearance, sound, and land use of wind turbines, particularily those who live near wind turbines. Electricity providers need to involve local communities in the planning process 
		during the development of wind farms to develop farms suitable to the local community. 
		
	</p>
	<p>
		Offshore wind faces additional challenges, and even today no offshore wind farms are present in Michigan. The Great Lakes holds cultural and ecological importance, resulting in less acceptance for offshore wind turbines. 
		People's aesthetic concerns are similar for onshore and offshore wind turbines with additional concerns for tourism. In the development of offshore wind farms, electricity providers must perform a study of the environment
		to avoid critical habitats and minimize disruptions to aquatic life. Site planners must also consult local stakeholders to address aesthetic and tourism concerns. Finally, engineers need to consider icy conditions in the winter during the design of the wind turbines.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Solar</h2>
	<p>
		Commercial solar should be implemented to cover a large portion of Michigan's energy generation during sunny months. In the case of home solar, for implementation it is crucial to convince homeowners to install panels. Be it monetarially or through some creative social processes, it will be costly. Not many are willing to foot the bill on their panels, even with a 30% Federal tax credit.
		Despite the low lighting concerns in Michigan, a relatively small installation on every home would effectively cover the residential portion of the power grid and decrease the capacity required of other potential energy sources. 
		Mandating enough solar panels for self-sufficiency on all new constructions, while a tough sell, would reduce the strain on other forms of generation and potentially cascade into more previously-built homes installing panels through a form of peer-pressure.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Solar Energy Challenges</h2>
	<p>
		Similar to wind, solar energy faces backlash from some residents about aesthetics and fears of decreasing property values. The government must work with local communities to carefully implement solar projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		A concentrated solar power plant may help produce a significant portion of the power that Michigan needs to produce, but Michigan has subobptimal conditions for concentrated solar that would reduce the efficiency and cost effectiveness. Because of this, alongside the large upfront cost, wind power or other solutions are probably better solutions, and a concentrated solar plant is not recommended.
	</p>
	<p>
		Due to low reliability in the winter months, solar energy production will need to be offset by other energy production or storage. Sources such as natural gas and biomass could serve to supplement solar energy production during winter months.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Biomass</h2>
	<p>
		Biomass can provide additional energy production by turning waste into energy. Facilities can burn tree trimmings, select construction waste, and other wood-based products. Implementation on a large scale would require the growth of plants for biomass energy conversion. Switchgrass and hybrid popular should be grown to provide 
		fuel for biomas conversion.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Biomass Energy Challenges</h2>
	<p>
		Biomass is a renewable energy source, but the conversion of energy in biomass plants produces many pollutants harmful to the environment and society. Biomass plants should be constructued away from vulnerable communities and local stakeholders should be involved in the planning process. Biomass can serve as an important step towards renewable energy that can provide the reliability sources like wind and solar can't while 
		polluting less than coal alternatives.

	<h2>Hydropower</h2>
	<p>
		Hydropower is a clean, renewable source which could be expanded to contribute around 5% of Michigan's energy production. Hydropower benefits local communities with cheaper energy, waterfront property, and new jobs.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Hydropower Energy Challenges</h2>
	<p>
		Hydropower requires a substantial upfront investment to build a hydroelectric power plant and requires the modification of the environment to create a dam. Careful planning is necessary to minimize the impact to the local environment. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Tax Incentives</h2>
	<p>
		Michigan must expand tax credits for renewable energy projects for both businesses and residents. In particular, tax credits for solar and land easements for community wind 
		could help to substantially expand renewable energy. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Energy Storage Development</h2>
	<p>
		Primarily relying on energy sources such as wind and solar provide additional concerns with reliability. While wind and solar can provide enough energy to power the state, varying weather conditions affect
		the ability to reliable produce enough energy. The state must support the research and development of battery storage to store energy during periods of excess generation and stabilize the grid during periods of weak solar and wind energy production. Additional technologies like pumped storage or hydrogen storage should also be explored to improve energy reliability.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Workforce Development</h2>
	<p>
		Expansion of renewables creates jobs in manufacturing, construction, and maintanance. However, workers must be trained to fill these new roles. Michigan must continue to 
		support training for employees looking for work in renewable energy. Initiatives such as the Clean Energy Workforce Development Program are necessary to develop the required workforce for renewable energy.
	</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
		Michigan's ambitious goal of 60% renewable energy by 2035 will require investment across wind, solar, biomass, and hydropower. Beyond a monetary investment, the government and electricity providers will need to include local stakeholders to ensure new projects minimize social and environmental impact while maximizing societal benefit.
		Tax incentives are a necessary step to encourage development of renewable energy. To meet Michigan's energy demand with renewable power, the state will need to development energy storage to manage the lower reliability of solar and wind. Finally, the state needs to support training to development the workforce required to construct and maintain
		renewable energy facilities. Reaching Michigan's goal of 60% renewable energy is a very important step to more sustainable energy production which is healthy for the environment and society.
