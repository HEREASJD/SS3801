	<h2>What is Hyrdoelectric Power?</h2> 
	<p>Hydroelectic power is the usage of waterflow to make turbines rotate to generate energy, this is most commonly applied through the useage of dams 
		which obstruct water flow into centralized points creating reservoirs. These reservoirs are then used to generate the strongest waterflow possible creating the greatest power output possible. </p>

					<li>Maintenance and repair costs are extremely high and as time progresses these costs only continue to rise</li>
					<li>Causes extreme harm to the local environment as it disrupts waterflow and sediment flow causing runoffs from rivers lowering water levels and disrupting lifecycles of local river species</li>

	<h2>Should Michigan use it?</h2>
	<p>Michigan should not move towards hydroelectric power. Due to recent regulations on dams, hydroelectric power has seen a major decrease in energy output down to 40% of its previous output. 
		This compounded by the costs of investement into new dams and the growing costs of their maintenance points towards it not being the optimal choice for Michigan's future expense and production wise. 
		 <br></br>
		 Hydroelectric power also fails on the local level of society. Although it does provide economic output for the local communities 
		 it often faces extreme restrictions and zoning issues enforced by local and state governments when getting started.  Hydroelectric power also 
		 fails locally on the environmental level as it damages the local environment of wildlife in their rivers.
