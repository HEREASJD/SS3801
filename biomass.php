    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>Biomass is a versatile and renewable energy source that utilizes organic materials.</p>
    <p>It offers an alternative to fossil fuels by using waste products and dedicated energy crops. 
    Biomass can significantly contribute to reducing carbon emissions and creating a sustainable energy future.</p>

                    <li>- Biomass accounted for 15% of Michigans renewable output in 2023 [10.]</li>
                    <li>- Biomass offset 950 jobs in Michigan with 750 being indirect jobs and 150 being direct jobs [11].</li>
                    <li>- Promotes sustainable waste management by offsetting Carbon Fossil Fuel Emissions [11].</li>
                    <li>- Mainly uses natural resources to produce its energy, and Michigan has a lot of them in the Upper Peninsula that could potentially be of use if the proper procedures get used to implement them..</li>

                    <li>- Processing and transportation can generate emissions thus increasing some of Michigan's carbon footprint..</li>
                    <li>- It is difficult to implement new plants and requires a lot of start-up costs which is why there are very few Biomass plants in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.</li>

    <!-- Discussion on Viability -->
    <h2>Is Biomass Viable?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Biomass energy is a promising renewable option, but its implementation must be carefully managed. 
    The competition for land use, emissions from processing, and setup costs are significant hurdles. 
    However, when sourced and utilized sustainably, biomass can serve as an important part of a carbon-neutral energy strategy. The state of Michigan has a lot of available land to continue their use of Biomass energy and using it would allow us to increase our use of positive renewable energy practices.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Policies promoting sustainable land use, subsidies for biomass energy systems, and public awareness campaigns can drive its adoption. 
    While not a universal solution, biomass can complement other renewable energy sources in a diversified energy portfolio.</p>
