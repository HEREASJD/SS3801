	With the passing of the Clean and Renewable Energy and Energy Waste Reduction Act, Michigan’s goal is to supply 60% of energy from renewable sources by 2035 and have 100% of energy come from clean sources by 2040 [28]. 
	For Michigan law, renewable energy comes entirely from sources that naturally regenerate over time (biomass, solar, hydrothermal, etc.), and clean energies emit minimal greenhouse gasses and have 90% of any emitted carbon captured before it reaches the atmosphere [28]. 
	Implementation of clean, renewable energy sources is a critical step forward for slowing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change. 
	Currently, electricity generation is responsible for the largest share of carbon emissions in Michigan at 29% [35]. 
	A transition to clean, renewable energy sources is a necessary step towards a healthier, sustainable climate and environment. The question remains as to how this goal should be best met. 
	The team’s goal is to determine, amongst the many possible energy production methods, which options are best for Michigan’s available space, climate, and workforce. The team will share information on potential energy sources and the best path forward on a website to inform Michiganders about the best way to improve energy production within the state.
