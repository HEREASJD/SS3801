	<h2>What is it?</h2>
	<p>
		Concentrated Solar Power concentrates sunlight with mirrors in order to collect it more efficiently. The mirrors are built in a variety of ways, including large parabolic curves and arrays of smaller dual-axis heliostats. There are also a variety of ways to produce electricity from the concentrated rays, including using heat to power a steam engine or stirling engine, and shining it directly onto specialized photovoltaic cells. Some concentrated solar systems are also used to heat up components of industrial processes directly.

				<ul>
					<li>Relatively cheap to maintain and keep running, as most moving parts are easy to individually replace, and failures in single mirrors do not disrupt energy production</li>
					<li>extremely low carbon emmissions while running, and low emmisions from being built compared to many other energy sources</li>
					<li>Once a concentrated solar plant is established, little effort is needed to keep producing power. Can be operated by a relatively small number of workers</li>
					<li>Unlike individual PV solar cells, concentrated solar can continue to generate power at least partially into the night due to the heat storage in the towers or pipes</li>
					<li>Much more variable and easier to use on demand than decentralized solar power</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>Sunlight varies with the season and weather, as well as the general climate of an area, which means that electricity production also varies</li>
					<li>Requires a large amount of land area, as production is directly tied to the amount of sunlight the plant can collect with mirrors</li>
					<li>Concentrated sunlight poses an invisible risk to birds and other animals if procedures aren't properly used to prevent dangerous areas</li>
					<li>The change in lighting contributes to light pollution, and can confuse animal migration patterns</li>
					<li>The up-front cost of building a plant is very high, requiring some specialized materials, clearing and leveling of a large area, and construction of structures that are both large and precise</li>
					<li>Due to the variation of solar power production throughout the day, if used as the primary energy source for an area, concentrated solar requires either a huge investment in batteries/other energy storage solutions, or building a larger plant than would be needed for ideal energy distribution</li>

	<h2>Should Michigan use it?</h2>
	<p>While concentrated solar is quickly growing more and more efficient, it is not a great pick to provide a majority of Michigan's power, due to its lower energy production in the winter months, when Michiganders will need the most power. Michigan also receives far less sunlight than most of the places where concentrated solar plants have been built, meaning that to produce similar amounts of power as those plants, more area and more mirrors would be needed.
	<br><br>If a concentrated solar plant was built in Michigan, it could potentially be extremely helpful in offsetting carbon emmissions by reducing the amount of power that is needed to be produced using other sources. However, concentrated solar is not currently a good option to supply a majority of Michigan's power, due to the seasonal variations in production, the large initial cost, and the non-ideal amount of sunlight that Michigan receives.</p>
